Hi, I am a PhD student at [Sato lab](https://www.ut-vision.org/), the University of Tokyo, supervised by Prof. [Yoichi Sato](https://sites.google.com/ut-vision.org/ysato/). I got my Master degree from Beihang University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Feng Lu](http://shi.buaa.edu.cn/lufeng/en/index.htm) ([PHI-AI](https://phi-ai.buaa.edu.cn/)). Previously, I received my BSc degree in Software Engineering from Shandong University in 2020.

**My research interests** lie in human computer interaction, computer vision, and AR/MR. Currently my research mainly focuses on egocentric vision and hand-related tasks. Previously, I was studying gaze estimation during my master program.
